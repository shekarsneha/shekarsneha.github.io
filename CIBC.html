                <p>How do we create tools to enable banking center employees to address clients while they're waiting in the lobby or in line for a teller? Can we service them earlier and address their needs using an iPad? </p>

                    I was involved with discovery sessions, grooming sessions and planning sessions throughout the project life cycle to help guide the direction of the sprints and what features would be added next. The product owner relied heavily on me to propose concepts for new features to be added into the project. 
                    Because of this expectation, I was also involved with ideating and finding the gap within the existing feature set.
